<div class="description" [@listStagger]="home$">
    <p>As far as I remember my interest in coding and computers in general was born out of a mere computer game (Road-Rash) not working on
        the PC we had back then.It used to run a windows 98 operating system(well that's all i knew apart from it is white in color).However
        one of my friend had a Windows Xp which was newly launched and would do the trick(as it looked to the child i was).
        The trauma of not being able to play a computer game set me thinking about how does this thing actually work.Progressing in
        age and education i learned that you can write SOME text SOMEWHERE and every computer in the world can do pretty much everything
        it does just by doing SOMETHING to that.Trying my level best to learn as much as i could from the godfather(The Internet)
        ,sacrificing some academic scores and not doing much of what other 12 year olds did i had pretty much faced a dead-end when
        writing a code was easy but executing it was not.Coding doesnt just teach you to think smartly
        it also strengthens your mind game.Dealing with frustration and yet not giving up on trying to make it work made it
        worthwhile.The Joy that you get at the end is second to none.All the life problems start feeling like cake.Today when i look
        at the errors and bugs i faced as an eight grader might seem like time and effort wasted at first but it truly is a part of
        a strong upbringing which invisibly is playing its role even today as i change my coding experience to intermediate from
        beginner.The lessons that learning entire of computer engineering on my own taught,confirmed that
        if you know many things about something you don't like doesnt take you anywhere ,but even if you are at the bottom of
        something you like ,it gives you the potential to figure your own way out to the top.</p>
